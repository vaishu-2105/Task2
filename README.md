1. Sub‑Category‑Wise Sales (Bar Chart)

   
On the left, a horizontal bar chart breaks down sales by sub‑category, with items like Phones, Chairs, Storage, Tables, Binders, Machines, and more.

The bar lengths visually rank sub‑categories by total sales, making it easy to identify top performers. Phones and Chairs sit at the top, while labels and fasteners sit at the bottom.


2. Category‑Wise Metrics (Donut Charts)

   
At the top of the visual panel, three radial donut charts display category-level breakdowns:

Category-wise Profit, showing proportions of profit by product category.

Category-wise Sales, depicting total sales distribution across categories.

Category-wise Quantity Sold, highlighting the quantity share per category.

These charts include numerical labels and percentage slices for each category.



3. State‑Wise Quantity Sold (Map Visualization)
   
A U.S. map with proportional bubble markers overlays
state-level data:

Larger circles indicate higher quantities sold in that state.

Smaller bubbles highlight states with lower sales.

The map spans coast to coast, from California and Texas to the Northeast.

This layer allows geographic comparison of performance across U.S. states.
